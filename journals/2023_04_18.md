- AR system for study 1 based on [[Rzayev et al 2020]]  was designed. Their findings suggested that general, non-critical notifications should be _observer-locked_. Observer-locked notifications are aligned with the user's partner's face, in the study these notifications were aligned to be centered across the partner's face or on the top right corner. A general consensus was not reached on which one of the placement was preferred more but the study suggests that the users should be given the option to pick. Centered notifications are somewhat favored as that doesn't break eye-contact and because the user can look at both his partner and read the notification. And the top-right position was found to be perceived as more urgent in comparison to center placed notifications
