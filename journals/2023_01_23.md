- [[Demo Version 2 - Marker-Based]]
  
  **Steffi's feedback**
	- Extended Marker Tracking component is built for mobile snapchat and not spectacles so the script needs to be updated to support the spectacles

- [[Demo Version 1 - Custom Landmarkers]]
  
  **Steffi's feedback**
	- Use spatial mapping along with (or instead of) custom landmarkers.
		- https://docs.snap.com/spectacles/templates/experimental/spatial-map
		- Spatial mapping is especially designed for spectacles.
			- Therefore, works better than custom landmarkers
	- She had used both a spatial map and a lidar scan
	- It's crucial to align the spatial map and the lidar scan
		- ScanIverse is a good lida scan application
