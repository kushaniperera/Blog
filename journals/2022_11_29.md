- [[Lens Studio 101]]
- Every time a lens is deployed to the spectacles this error pops up: "Lens requires a higher app version 12.08.0.0". And after 3 days of struggling to fix it, because everything is as up-to-date as they could be, posted this issue on their forum, just for them to tell me:
  "_Spectacles currently only support Lenses created in Lens Studio 4.28.1 or earlier. You can download 4.28.1 from [here](https://apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Far.snap.com%2Fdownload%2Fv4-28-1&data=05%7C01%7Ckushani.perera%40postgrad.otago.ac.nz%7C91c2aeef38514049002a08dad1a3c1e3%7C0225efc578fe4928b1579ef24809e9ba%7C0%7C0%7C638052798520613891%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=dTcnlC8dE0xw1R85VzgK6OwaNl0WwRD097Fvn4KXhsQ%3D&reserved=0).
   
  Note that you may need to downgrade your project to make it compatible. Typically that just means opening your project in the older program and recreating any materials. To be safe, you may want to put the contents of your project into a single scene object and then right click and export it, then import the iso into 4.28.1._"
- Yay anyway!
