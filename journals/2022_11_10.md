- Some issues with building the unity project caused by missing components in visual studio
- [[Kelly & Gilbert 2016]]
- Looked into sketchup
	- [Comparison of the 3 versions](https://help.sketchup.com/en/sketchup-schools/getting-started-sketchup-schools)
	- Sketchup Free is obviously free and on web but **only** supports STL & PNG export formats, that would not work for me.
	- Sketchup for Schools surprisingly let me log in and use it, has FBX and is on web
	- Sketchup Pro supports FBX exports and is a standalone app $299/yr
		- Another option is Sketchup for Higher Education seems to be quite similar at $55/yr
