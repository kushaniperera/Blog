- Some issues with building the unity project caused by missing components in visual studio
- [[Kelly & Gilbert 2016]]
- Looked into sketchup
	- /link
	- Sketchup Free is obviously free and on web but **only** supports STL & PNG export formats, that would not work for me.
	- Sketchup for Schools surprisingly let me log in and use it, has FBX and is on web
	- Sketchup Pro supports FBX exports and is a standalone app.
