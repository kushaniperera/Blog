- Pervasive AR systems tightly integrate computing, display, sensing, networking, and user interaction technology
- Instead of using and controlling dedicated apps for different purposes as with AR glasses, Pervasive AR aims to integrate relevant user interface elements into the current spatial and temporal context of the user in a continuous, adaptive, and omnipresent way. Pervasive AR glasses are intended to be worn constantly to assist with a coherent and meaningful merging of real and virtual reality at the right time and at the right place.
- The more regularly an augmentation is presented to a user, the more they will adapt to it and incorporate it behaviourally: studies of perceptual plasticity demonstrate this point
- The system emulated a pervasive AR system of the future by using state-of-the art 
  AR glasses and, after initial setup, a user interface which did not require any manual interaction by the user. Users were able to walk freely around and get context-adaptive augmentations without the need for active intervention or control."
- our PAR users were quite aware of the (potential) capture of behaviour data (DataAware), and were neutral to negative about whether this data capture would be ethically acceptable (DataAccept). While no behaviour data capture actually happened in our experiment, participants might well have assumed it was happening, because of the (mocked-up) ‘personal data’ augmented on top of the lanyard persona cards.
- Ratings given for potentially breached privacy (PrivacyAware) and potential concerns about those breaches (PrivacyConcern) were quite low.
- the bystanders found it rather awkward how the PAR users looked (and behaved) (Awkward). But they were inconclusive as to whether this would be considered as normal (Normal).
- glasses seemed to be appropriate (Appropriate) and certainly not considered as rude (Rude)
- neither felt comfortable nor uncomfortable to watch PAR users using the glasses, but people would feel distracted by people wearing PAR glasses in public (Distracting).
- This resulted in split groupings of only PAR users or only bystanders coming together to look and discuss the paintings or the information revealed by the glasses. It also engendered feelings of missing out (for the bystanders) and uncomfortable privilege
- Having to stare, instead of an easy quick glance, and having access to personal information about someone, without them knowing, created significant social awkwardness and made especially PAR users self-conscious.
  
  Bystanders were seen to be equally uncomfortable, and were often frustrated, especially when they felt that not all information was communicated to them."
- Participants felt the PAR glasses had the potential to cause divisions in society through the asymmetry of access to information, social status and disconnect from reality
- PAR glasses were seen as pervading all aspects of everyday life, from work opportunities to participation to social and fun activities. Interestingly, the option to ’opt out’ was not perceived as a viable one which made the exclusionary effect even more problematic.
- PAR glasses were considered particularly problematic in the context of social interactions as they were seen as creating a boundary and significantly altering the way people engage with each other.
  In addition to the social awkwardness, a distinct otherness was felt and the social judgement went both ways, deepening the divide.
  The disconnect from the real world as well as the merging and conflation of what is real and what is not, were seeing as having potential (detrimental) implications for people’s mental health.
  In the focus groups, participants generally did not find the PAR glasses to be more ethically concerning than current technologies such as mobile phones, social media or other smart internet connected devices.
  For many participants the biggest issue was that this capability could be ’always on’, available in an unprompted all seeing and not transparent manner
  Participants also expressed concerns around what they saw as an unprompted and passive consumption of information which exacerbates the current practice of looking someone or something up with potential implications to people’s mental health and developing new forms of or expanding addictive behaviours.
  Others felt that accountability and moral responsibility need to be attributed and checked long before such technologies reach end users, starting with the companies that make them, from the coders – and their potential inherent bias – to the company ethos and policies.
  "we propose that any future decision-making for PAR technologies should involve a
  space, perhaps incorporating digital civics methods from our current study, to ensure equal and democratic participation about how these technologies should be used and developed."
  We suggest that the required digital civics space should go beyond traditional education and instructional training, and involve a wider societal ‘professionalization’ process (cf [7]) akin to arts education.
  First and foremost, hierarchical access to information in an omnipresent way would have great impact on societal interaction in general. Second, we users/citizens must be aware of the existence and the changing nature of those hierarchies. Finally, we have to understand the underlying principles and mechanisms of information delivery and access.
  Designers of PAR systems will have greater power over users, and greater responsibility.
  As different contexts may be liable to different permissions and controls, it is important to make explicit who owns and controls the seeing and collecting of information at any given context [43] and the ability to control for PAR users about what is displayed, by whom, and with what purpose.
  AR/VR devices use observable data to enable users to construct a virtual presence, whether in fully virtual spaces created in VR or physical spaces enhanced with virtual elements through AR.
