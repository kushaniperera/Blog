- [[card]] The Technological Acceptance Model says that users' attitude towards using a technology  is influenced by,
  1. perceived usefulness; i.e. the extent to which the new technology will improve their performance and,
  2. perceived ease of use; i.e. how much effort is required by this technology
  
  There have been several other replications of this model such as the model by Segars and Grover that explored the additional influential factor, effectiveness.
  
  Some extensions of the model have also been developed such as the TAM2 that defines perceived usefulness and ease of use in terms of social influence and cognitive instrumental processes
