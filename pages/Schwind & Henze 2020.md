- [[card]] In this study the authors build on their previous study and investigating how devices' warmth and competence (SCM factors) affect those devices' social acceptability. The paper follows two studies that utilises 12 predefined devices and 12 predefined social groups. In the first study the participants assess the warmth and competence of 12 devices and the devices' social acceptability (WEAR). The findings suggest that the SCM position of the devices are correlated to the results of the SA tests of the devices. (SA increases when warmth and competence increase). In the second study, initially the participants assess the warmth and competence (W&C) of the 12 social groups, then the W&C of the devices and the probability of each defined group using each of the devices. Findings of the study suggest that the W&C of the devices are resulted by the W&C of its anticipated users.
