Top-right of user's view, 3. Center overlaid on the observer, 4. Top right of the observer. The focus of this research was to establish a notification position with the least disruption to the user's social interactions. The study was conducted using a Hololens application that sends each type of notification a few seconds apart. After receiving each notification the users and the observers filled in questionnaires. The findings from this study state that
