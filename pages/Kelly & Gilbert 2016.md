- [[card]] This paper goes through the first three studies in developing a scale for evaluating the acceptability of wearables, WEarable Acceptability Range (WEAR Scale). This scale is expected to help developers in designing. In the first study the authors formulate items for the scale via interviewing a sample population to identify their impression of social acceptability and the terminology they use to describe them, these items were then reviewed against the literature survey, resulting in the addition of more items and removal of redundant items. In the second study, the formulated items were reviewed by 3 experts who rated their relevance, evaluated the clarity and gave feedback about the items. And in the 3rd study, initially, the expert reviewed and revised scale was presented to few members of the population based on whose feedback the scale was further refined. 
  
  There's a few more remaining steps to be carried out  to complete the development of the scale. Such as, the evaluation of the items to pick the most valuable items in terms of correlation between items, variance of items and the item means. Then, to determine the effectiveness of the resulting item removal via Cronbach's Alpha and to determine the construct validity.

  "_The problem in developing commercial applications for wearables is that these technologies intersect with manners, moral codes, the symbolic communication of dress, habits of dress, fashion, context of use, form, and aesthetics._"
  "_A wearable, for the purposes of developing the WEAR Scale, is a small computational device or accessory that is worn on the body in public. A wearable is personal, and personally- owned, and is at least minimally visible and comfortable. Donning a wearable requires action, which is preceded by decision-making about the social acceptability of the action and the anticipated reaction of others.
  A socially acceptable wearable is most notably marked by an absence of negative reactions or judgments from others._" #Dictionary
