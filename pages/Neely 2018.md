- different technologies do not necessarily integrate well with each other—we are currently limited to a large degree by the particular applications or technologies we are using to access the augmented world. In the future, however, a much more  seamless experience might be possible."
- With any new technology, we need to ask both how it can be used and who is permitted to use it.
- both how the technology develops and what sort of space we are considering will be relevant in determining whether a person is permitted to augment a particular space.
- the very nature of augmented reality complicates the notion of rights because it is not clear how to translate them into augmented space; the rights we have recognized in physical space and virtual space do not entirely line up
- the “space” (whether physical or virtual) is something you can ethically restrict the use of.
- the ontology of augmented reality complicates matter. Virtual property or objects of the sort legal cases are concerned with exist within a virtual world which must be entered; it thus has a separation from the physical world.
- While a webpage or blog has a specific address, and in that sense has a location of a sort, again it is not strongly tied to a physical place. Moreover, in general the virtual location could be changed without diminishing its content—it needs an address so that people can locate the content, but its content does not depend on that address
- I may allow other people to place certain kinds of temporary signs—if my house is on the corner of two streets, someone else may place a sign with an arrow to their yard sale on my lot—but they generally stay only because I choose to allow them; if I needed to remove them in order to have work completed (or even because I am supremely grumpy) that would be ethically acceptable
- It is somewhat less clear how to deal with the case of private property if the augmentation occurs over multiple apps rather than in a single sphere. I tend to agree with Wassom
  (2015) that in such cases one person’s augmentation is unlikely to prevent augmentation from another; since there are multiple ways to create and access the augmentations, there is much more space for multiple augmentations."
- If a popular augmentation is interfering with the intended use of the space then the owner is
  being harmed."
- it is not the content per se but the juxtaposition of the content and location.
- In this way, augmented reality is not completely like a web page, even in the case with multiple platforms, because the need to tie the virtual content to a specific physical place will sometimes require us to consider whether the juxtaposition is itself ethical.
- The case of augmenting private property, therefore, seems to turn on how AR technology is implemented
- Just as a person has rights over their physical property, so too should they have rights over augmentations to that property.
- Public property:
  
  Issues about privacy violations seem less likely to occur, given the public nature of the space, and there would be plenty of room for multiple augmentations."
- The state does not have the right to choose the topics of conversation within its public places. The fact that some of those conversations are virtual in nature would be irrelevant; the state cannot ethically choose the topic of your texts from a public location either.
- On the other hand, if we see augmentation as graffiti albeit frequently helpful or interesting graffiti—then it seems more within the state’s purview to control.
- There’s also an interesting question about whether there might be good reason to prevent augmentation of a particular space even if the augmentation itself is not problematic. For instance, perhaps a piece of public art should be experienced as it is, rather than having people
  view its augmentations and thus experience it only through the lens of pre-conceived notions."

- **Augmented reality (AR)** is a particular blend of the physical and the virtual; specifically, it is the use of technology in order to project digital content onto our experience of the physical world. #definition
	- Augmented reality has both virtual and physical components to experience the virtual content, one needs to be in a particular physical place. It is thus unlike virtual property or spaces because it is directly tied to locations in our geographic  world; you cannot experience the content from afar. However, it is unlike regular physical property because of its virtual component—simply being in a specific geographic location will not be enough to experience augmented reality; one must also have the correct technology.
