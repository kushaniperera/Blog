- [[card]] This study focuses on the bystanders' perception of being recorded by PAR devices. The researchers had interviewed bystanders in cafés where an AR-glass user was planted. Majority of the participants were indifferent to being recorded owing to the prolonged exposure to CCTVs that has somewhat normalised surveillance to an extent. Participants shared their views about being recorded in terms of several concerns, being recognised through the footage, it being a nuisance, the context in which it would be shared or the recorded bystander behaviour and place (eg)
- [[card]] Notably, many of the bystanders didn't even notice that there was an AR user among them until probed by the researcher. Does that mean we have on a subconscious level become more accepting or rather indifferent towards technology? Or have we after decades of trying to protect our privacy and devices listening in, finally given up?
- #Paratyping is a methodology for collecting in- situ feedback from bystanders via situated experience prototyping. With this technique, participants are recruited to act as proxies for the researchers. Participants carry short surveys and distribute them to bystanders with whom they interact. The surveys, which are returned by mail
