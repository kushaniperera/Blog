- [[card]] This study explores the ability of user's and bystanders to perceive the new sensor capabilities integrated to PAR devices via an augmented zoom in. This aspect is tested along several themes namely, privacy, ethics and usability. Further, a special focus is given to how the wearer's social status/ role impact the acceptance of the device. In terms of privacy, the participants suggested
- [[card]] Interestingly, some participants noted that our obliviousness/ unawareness of PAR makes any recording/ staring at be perceived as less of a privacy threat.
