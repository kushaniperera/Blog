- Augmented Reality (AR) is a user interface metaphor, which allows for interweaving digital data with physical spaces
- We call this continuous AR experience Pervasive Augmented Reality as an continuous, omnipresent, and universal augmented interface to information in the physical world. #definition
- The concept of Pervasive Augmented Reality requires that the AR system can adapt to the current, changing requirements and constraints of the user’s context and thus allows for a continuous usage.
- In fact, context-aware AR user interfaces can be seen as an instance of recommender systems, as
  they present adapted content to users, based on their specific situation.
- **Pervasive Augmented Reality** is a continuous and pervasive user interface that augments the physical world with digital information registered in 3D, while being aware of and responsive to the users context. #definition
- The main difference between PAR and conventional AR is the temporal component of the use. Conventional AR systems are used rather sporadically, ad-hoc and not in a continuous mode like PAR systems.
- To date, AR applications are designed to be used in a restricted, specific context while PAR applications must work in all contexts and be adaptive and context aware only PAR delivers a true augmented reality experience by moving away from simple information overlay, which is added to a scene towards actual information augmentation, embedding  virtuality into reality.
- Given that AR emphasizes visual augmentation, a main target for adaption is an adapted graphical representation of the content.
- Most of these systems are aware of personal context factors or environment factors to apply changes to the displayed content.
- As a first step, they propose to determine body posture and to analyze the user’s environment. Both together are used as input to machine learning algorithms to derive knowledge about the situation and intentions of the user.
