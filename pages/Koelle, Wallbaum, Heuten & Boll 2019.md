- [[card]] This paper outlines a diary study to evaluate the effectiveness of screen-based status indicators for wearable cameras. Their findings are as follows, bystanders often didn't notice the indicator at all or misinterpreted it as a game or a medical assistance tool, the indicator affected the user's confidence and made them uneasy about how they might be perceived. The authors further state that diary study would be a suitable testing mechanism for social acceptability as it allows for natural, in the wild testing, but that the prototypes should indicate a perceived value for the user and that the participants' study-related behaviour should be taken in to consideration in the results.
