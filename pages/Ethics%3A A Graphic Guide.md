- #Morals
	- Socrates: Morality isn't just oobeying the law, but something much more spiritual. Once we know who we are (Purpose/ function), we will know how to behave well.
	- Plato: Morality is not a human convention but a part of the structure of the universe itself., Morality of the individual and morality of the state are the same.
	- Aristotle: Moral's are inherently instilled and developed over time through practice. Morals help choose the best mean to an end that will give a sense of fulfillment.
