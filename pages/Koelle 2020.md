- [[card]] The authors focus on the subject of social acceptability (SA) in HCI. Even though there aren't any straight forward methods to evaluate social acceptability, they have conducted a survey of studies and the methods used to address social acceptability. The authors survey social acceptability in HCI in terms of the study environment used (lab, field study, field setting), method of evaluation used (surveys, questionnaire, independent reporting), design strategies used to promote SA (subtle movements, avoiding bystander misinterpretation, using familiar gestures, accessory-like devices that do not stand out).
  Discussing the environments they survey from studies they've identified that the level of control in  environments vary and present with problems such as lab experiments lack ecological validity which is present in field studies but they lacked controlled and the authors recommend studies in controlled and unconstrained environments
  In terms of evaluation SA still lacks a generalised established method of evaluation or questionnaire. Surveyed studies have used customised questionnaires that use a range of adjectives making these evaluations uncomparable and lacking generalisabilty. Standard questionnaires and vocabulary is needed.
  Design strategies that promote SA need to be evaluated and standardised, further recommends user participation in design from early on.
- [[card]] [[study ideas]] in terms of social acceptability of gestures it would be a forward thinking idea to look into metaphorical gestures much like the UI metaphors used.
  Though customised questionnaires lack generalisability, I think it's necessary to evaluate particular prototypes. So custoomisation of questionnaires allow us frame our evaluation in a manner that suits our prototype or purpose. But, a standardised vocabulary indeed will make these customisations more comparable as that will ensure that all participants across studies receive the same idea or understanding.
  Though field setting studies seem the most intriguing I do not understand how we would guarantee the user's pure participation in such a study.
  In terms of user participated design might in fact help with ethical issues and SA so I need to look into Value
