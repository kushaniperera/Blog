  Chapter 1 outlines the evolution of AR with examples that readers are familiar with.

  Geofencing - "*This refers to the establishment of invisible boundaries in real space, the crossing of which triggers a digital response*"
  _"The technology that enhances the touch is better known as 'haptics'."_
  Aural AR: Snap Spectacles, instead of delivering in ear sounds, opts for bone-conduction audio, so the user remains receptive to the real-world audio stimulants.

  This chapter introduces the concept of Privacy, when and where privacy rights maybe applicable. The author writes about the privacy issues surveillance/ sousiveillance via wearables, IoT devices such as geotrackers, facial recognition, bio data collection will pose especially if they're used by retailer and law enforcement. Further, he points out how regulators do not yet identify most of these privacy threats in terms formulating new laws, rules and regulations.
  
  Conlcluding the chapter, he suggests that though AR wearables might come with their own privacy issues they can also be used to solve them. Such as, given the wide canvas available to display information, it can show the users which devices in his vicinity might be collecting data and/or what data it might be collecting.

  "_As long as one's speech has any arguable connection to issues that affect the well-being or interest of more than just those involved in the conversation — what the law calls 'matters of public concern'—then the right to express that view will almost always be protected by the First Amendment. By contrast, 'matters of private concerns' are those that the law recognises as not being the legitimate business of anyone other than those directly affected by them. These– and, for the most part, only these – issues the law will protect as 'private'._"
  Thereby, certain speech shall only be unethical but not illegal. The user would in fact be rightfully allowed to convey them regardless of it being malicious or offensive.
  
  "_It [The First Amendement] explains, for example, why privacy laws cannot prevent individuals from collecting and repeating information that is freely available in public places— such as overheard sights and sounds — including by recording them_"
  Privacy laws do not protect a bystander from being recorded in a public place Just unethical. Making consent rather a nicety than an actual requirement.
  
  The right to be left alone protects a person from being recorded in a private space, having their private facts shared publicly and defamation through sharing facts.
- On Souisveillance, the author mentions that you can sometimes forget you're wearing the recording device at all. The more inconspicuous a device is, the more likely it is for you to feel as if it's not there at all. There might be an ethics angle here. To explore! [[study ideas]]

  "... _ownership of real property is the right to possess and exclude others from a parcel of land._"
  "..._property ownership is also understood to include the right of 'quiet and peaceful' enjoyment of the land._"
