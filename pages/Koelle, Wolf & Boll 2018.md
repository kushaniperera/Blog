- [[card]] The study identifies the shortcomings of LED camera recording indication of wearables and has groups of experts develop alternative design artifacts to serve the purpose of indication while also addressing, noticeability (i.e. the indication should be clearly noticeable to the user and bystanders), understandability (i.e. the intention of the recording should be communicated), security (i.e. the status of the camera shouldn't be concealable/ spoofable) and trustworthiness. These artifacts are then evaluated by independent UX and HCI experts who rate them in terms of the four characteristics and finally provide recommendations such as the importance of both consent and noticeability, avoiding the requirement of apriori knowledge and enabling bystanders to tell if they're being secretly recorded.
- [[card]] consent though difficult to be obtained must be strongly urged especially, because recording in public spaces voids the privacy protection in the eyes of the law enforcement. I felt like consent should have been identified as a characteristic to address, mostly because consent is something that truly enables privacy.
  
  [[Study Ideas]] might be able to combine this with the souisveillance ethical issue from [[Wassom 2015]] and create something substantial that could be tested.
