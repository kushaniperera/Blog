- [[card]] The study identifies the shortcomings of LED camera recording indication of wearables and has groups of experts develop alternative design artifacts to serve the purpose of indication while also addressing, noticeability (i.e. the indication should be clearly noticeable to the user and bystanders), understandability (i.e. the intention of the recording should be communicated), security (i.e. the status of the camera shouldn't be )
