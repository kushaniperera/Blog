- To augment the most helpful and relevant content in any context, Pervasive AR systems need to capture the spatial and temporal context using a diverse array of sensors to determine, e.g., location, orientation, physical environment, gestures, and aspects of the user’s state.
  "Location& Tracking:
- LOCATION AND TRACKING
  
  Future Pervasive AR systems will use those not just for building 3D representations of selected indoor environments but for reconstructing the entire physical world around the user while at the same time using those representations to track the position of the user."
- Pervasive AR benefits from the use of “intelligent user interfaces,” which adapt to the current context of use by incorporating a comprehensive user model, environmental awareness, and continuous sensing and tracking.
- Pervasive AR devices can long-term capture detailed information about the user.
  Hence, if exploited, the data captured in Pervasive AR opens up pathways to build models not only about the user but also everything else in the user’s view and environment."
- Pervasive AR faces the challenge that there is no simple opt-out mechanism as data is collected as part of its functionality. This is even more true for people affected by using Pervasive AR once it becomes omnipresent.We cannot assume all people in the environment to indicate (e.g., via a beacon) their consent.
- "Pervasive AR: We see the following three areas of particular relevance when discussing health and safety concerns:
  1) perceptual distraction and blind spots;
  2) ergonomics; and
  3) long-term effects of AR exposure."
- While Pervasive AR requires less user input, gaze and eye based
  interfaces are likely to play a more important role with potential unknown long-term effects."
- continuous augmentation of information into the field of view of a user undoubtedly will lead to issues with attention, cognitive workload, and distraction, if not addressed properly.
- In particular, when snap decisions by users are required in potentially high workload situations. One way to mitigate this is to reintroduce the disbelief similarly to the “device gap.” 
  There is already research on different styles how to finish an immersive experience and effects for breaks in  illusion and we would advocate for more research into how to leave and re-enter computer-generated realities."
  Similarly, we should give the users control over the level of deception, e.g., by placing “halos” around virtual objects, or a level 0–10 control of the degree of visibility of virtuality in the  experienced scene
  "Overall, we strongly argue for a “Breaking the Magician’s Code” action; by revealing the following:
  a) the visible illusion;
  b) other sensory illusions (e.g., acoustic, haptic);
  c) the logical relationship of actions and simulations in the environment;
  d) references to sources of information used to produce the illusion."
  "Once usage of AR is commonplace it will change the perception of our surrounding environment.
  Places and spaces currently defined by, e.g., streets, buildings, people, and their appearance will suddenly also be affected by the presence and appearance of their virtual counterparts."
  Property owners have legal rights over their property but this does not explicitly extend to the virtual space, which can lead to various inappropriate uses of AR.
  Pervasive AR can increase inequities if access to it is not universal.
  access to virtual space with Pervasive AR can be manipulated or restricted in ways that limit freedom of expression and the ability to learn about diverse perspectives.
  "the creation of digital twins of real places and potentially real people that can be created and assessed with the help of Pervasive AR technology highlights challenges in the traditional understanding of rights and in enabling access.
  In particular, (1) who has the right to provide augmented information, who owns the virtual real estate, or does one own its digital twin including the right to not have a digital twin? but also (2) which users get the right of access not only to the enabling technology (glasses, operating infrastructure) but also to the information to be displayed continuously?"
  the continuous nature combined with a context-aware interface amplifies the ethical issues,
