- [[card]] This paper has surveyed studies as a continuation from Azuma et al 1997. The paper focuses on studies in several themes; majorly, surrounding the shortfalls of AR as in 2001. The themes covered are as follows, displays; low resolution, low latency, brightness, depth perception, plane tracking, calibration, location tracking are some of those identified issues of AR displays. 
  Then the authors discuss the deficits in interfaces such as how users interact with AR systems and suggests they require to be intuitive and appropriate in terms of the application.
  Next, Visualisation weaknesses such as data overload and rendering issues are discussed
  This section ends with discussing social acceptability especially when AR systems are cumbersome with multiple sensors and battery pack and the implied privacy issues.
  In the final section they've discussed recent AR applications in the domain.
- [[card]] the studies surveyed aren't particularly important because they are rather dated but, the issues discussed now, 2 decades later have mostly if not all have been overcome by the new available AR devices. So the paper provides a good baseline for the evolution of AR technology.
