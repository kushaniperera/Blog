- [[card]] This paper has surveyed studies as a continuation from Azuma et al 1997. The paper focuses on studies in several themes; majorly, surrounding the shortfalls of AR as in 2001. The themes covered are as follows, displays; low resolution, low latency, brightness, depth perception, plane tracking, calibration, location tracking are some of those identified issues of AR displays,
