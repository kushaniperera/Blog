They've conducted two sessions of the experiment in a university cafeteria, one to observe the users and the other to observe the spectators. Both qualitative and quantitative data has been gathered from the two groups in the form of structured interviews and likert based questionnaire surveys. Following this they've extended the study by using the findings from the two sessions to formulate VR design suggestions with expert UX designers and an SE. The UX experts have come up with 28 recommendations to improve the social acceptability of VR in public contexts in terms of providing a seamless medium of communication between the users and the spectators that wouldn't disturb the immersion,
