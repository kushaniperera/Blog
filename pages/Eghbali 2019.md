- [[card]] This study explores the experience of both users and bystanders when using a VR application facilitated via an HMD in a public setting. They've conducted two sessions of the experiment in a university cafeteria, one to observe the users and the other to observe the spectators. Both qualitative and quantitative data has been gathered from the two groups in the form of structured interviews and likert based questionnaire surveys. Following this they've extended the study by using the findings from the two sessions to formulate VR design suggestions with expert UX designers and an SE. The UX experts have come up with 28 recommendations to improve the social acceptability of VR in public contexts in terms of providing a seamless medium of communication between the users and the spectators that wouldn't disturb the immersion, improving the users' spatial awareness for safety, ability to naturally switch between reality and virtuality, etc.
- [[card]] If the study had been done in a more true social context, the results would've been more generalisable because it's easy to assume that university communities are aware of these technologies and their capabilities to some extent. 
  
  "*The isolation of the user from the others can create a form of social gap that may affect the social acceptability of VR in public context.*"
  "*User needs to be provided the option to choose a discrete public mode of interaction that would require less extensive movements.
  Users should be able to stay isolated in VR when they want and be able to enjoy the VR experience without being interrupted by outside noise.
   User needs to have a communication channel with the outside without losing their sense of immersion. 
  The user needs the ability to switch between the virtual world and the real world at will.*"
  "*The presence of others and fear of contact with people can affect the interaction.
  Being in a private space may have allowed more unrestricted movements*"
  "*if users can share some aspects of VR use with the spectators in the public context, the chances of social acceptability will increase. *"
  "**Those using VR will also forget the presence of others after some moments of being immersed, even if there are lots of other people around. A finding that highlights the difference of opinion from the viewpoint of the users and spectators was how they experienced isolation: While the spectators did not like the fact that they were isolated from the user, most of the users enjoyed the sense of isolation*"
