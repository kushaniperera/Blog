- Augment Reality is when the virtual objects in a scenario are meaningfully aligned with the real world.
- To be Augmented Reality, the application must create augmentations that are perceivable by our senses (usually vision), and which are aligned to the real world.
- Augmented Reality strikes right at the heart of philosophy, particularly epistemology.
- Augmented Reality works by allowing a computer to pre-process all input before it is provided to our senses. Because Augmented Reality mediates our experience of reality, it has the potential to completely remake our social institutions and our selves, how we know and what we do.
- Virtuality can only be a limited, specialised, occasional and place bound tool for entertainment, and the realm of a few die-hards and addicts.
- It (AR) will become pervasive not by replacing reality, but by becoming an indispensable medium for doing the things that we already need to do.
- Artists have used light projection to make walls and rooms of a hotel move around, and fall down. In the language of copyrights this is creating derivative work, and right to create derivative works is reserved by the copyright  holder, not the public.
- In short, the labor theory of property says that commons become private property when we expend labor to make them useful and productive.
- I will argue augmented reality, if it became pervasive, will force a reformation of property rights and governance, because the metaphors on which current thinking is based will break down. Both the ethics and the law of the situation wll change. Even if we take no legislative action, the introduction of this new technology will force the courts to re-evaluate and re-interpretour existing laws.
- It would not be hard to create a system that allows the user to find out who posted an augmentation, and/ or flag a particulat augmentation as objectionable. If a use posts a shocking image over another person's head in a cafe the other users nearby can flag it as obscene, and the user that posted it could have his or her account suspended.
