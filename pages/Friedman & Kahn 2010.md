- [[card]] The authors have written about their opinion on AR in terms of seven values using two of their studies, more predominantly an AR garden study and its implications on these values. The seven values explored are as follows: psychological well-being, physical well-being, privacy, deception, informed consent, ownership and property, and trust.  
  Brief descriptions about how AR would impact each of these values is given.
- [[card]] In the psychological well-being aspect, the authors have narrowly only focused on the benefits (sticking to the same example) and have ignored possible triggering or trauma-inducing content that could be delivered via AR.
  Provides a very clear framework thats applicable to exploring ethical implications of PAR
- TODO look into Value-Sensitive Design
