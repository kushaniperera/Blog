	- [[card]] E Dick covers privacy issues in AR/VR in terms of four data types, Observed, Observable, Computed and Associated. Further identifies that AR/VR collects a substantial amount of data compared to other technologies due to the use of sensors which makes it difficult for a user to remain anonymous and retain their autonomy but this collected information is vital for the AR/VR applications to function.
